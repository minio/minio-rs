# Claude Code Style Guide for MinIO Rust SDK

- Only provide actionable feedback.
- Exclude code style comments on generated files. These will have a header signifying that.
- Use github markdown folded sections for all items.
- Do not use emojis.
- Do not add a "feel good" section.

## Copyright Header

All source files that haven't been generated MUST include the following copyright header:

```rust

```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Ignore files
- Ignore files from processing mentioned under '.gitignore'

### Comments
- **NO redundant comments** - Code should be self-documenting
- Avoid obvious comments like `// Set x to 5` for `x := 5`
- Only add comments when they explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic

## Critical Code Patterns

### Builder Pattern
All S3 API requests MUST use the builder pattern, with the following documentation but then for the appropriate API

```rust
/// Argument builder for the [`AppendObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-append.html) S3 API operation.
///
/// This struct constructs the parameters required for the [`Client::append_object`](crate::s3::client::Client::append_object) method.
```

**Key Requirements:**
1. The aws docs url must exist. 

### Error Handling Pattern
All Rust SDK methods should follow consistent error handling patterns:

```rust
impl Client {
    pub async fn operation_name(&self, args: &OperationArgs) -> Result<OperationResponse, Error> {
        // Validate inputs early
        args.validate()?;

        // Build request
        let request = self.build_request(args)?;

        // Execute with proper error propagation
        let response = self.execute(request).await?;

        // Parse and return
        OperationResponse::from_response(response)
    }
}
```

## Code Quality Principles

### Why Code Quality Standards Are Mandatory

Code quality standards are **critical business requirements** for MinIO Rust SDK:

1. **Enterprise Data Safety**: A single bug can corrupt terabytes of customer data across distributed systems
2. **Code Efficiency**: MinIO Rust SDK code must be efficient and performant
3. **Scalability**: MinIO Rust SDK must be able to handle thousands of concurrent requests
4. **High Availability**: Systems must handle failures gracefully - unpredictable code creates cascading failures
5. **Developer Velocity**: New team members must understand complex distributed systems quickly and safely

### Predictable Code Requirements

Code must exhibit **deterministic behavior** to ensure system reliability:

1. **Managed State**: Use Arc<Mutex<>> or Arc<RwLock<>> for shared state that needs thread-safe access across async operations
2. **Explicit Dependencies**: Business logic dependencies should be passed as parameters or dependency injection
3. **Deterministic Operations**: Avoid time-dependent logic, random values, or platform-specific behavior in core paths
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Same error conditions must always produce identical error responses
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Operations should be safely repeatable without unintended side effects

### Readability Standards

Complex distributed systems code must remain **human-readable**:

1. **Self-Documenting Code**: Function and variable names should clearly express business intent
2. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns (HTTP handlers, error handling, logging)
3. **Logical Flow**: Code should read as a clear narrative from top to bottom
4. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Each function should have a single, well-defined responsibility
5. **Clear Abstractions**: Break complex operations into well-named, focused helper functions

### Separation of Concerns

**Architectural layers must maintain clear boundaries**:

1. **Handler Layer**: HTTP request/response processing, input validation, context creation
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic orchestration, data transformation
3. **Storage Layer**: Data persistence, replication, consistency management
4. **Utility Layer**: Reusable helpers with no business logic dependencies
5. **Shared State Coordination**: Use thread-safe primitives (Arc, Mutex, RwLock) for components needing consistent views

### Functions and Methods
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose and business intent
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting complexity
- Error handling should be immediate and explicit
- **Function length guideline**: Most functions should be under 100 lines; handlers may be longer due to validation logic
- **Parameter limits**: Prefer structs over long parameter lists for better maintainability

### Variables
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect business concepts
- Variable names should reflect usage frequency: frequent variables can be shorter
- Constants should follow Rust patterns
- Global variables should be clearly identified and documented for their system-wide purpose

### Developer Documentation

**All significant features must include developer documentation** in the `docs/` directory:

1. **API Documentation**: New endpoints must have usage examples in `docs/`
2. **Architecture Decisions**: Complex algorithms or design patterns should be documented
3. **Configuration Changes**: New config options must be documented with examples
4. **Integration Guides**: External system integrations need clear setup instructions
5. **Future Developer Context**: Document WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was implemented

## Testing Requirements

### Why Unit Tests Are Mandatory

Unit tests are **non-negotiable** in this project for critical business reasons:

1. **Data Integrity**: MinIO Rust SDK handles enterprise-critical data. A single bug can cause data loss affecting thousands of users
2. **Security Compliance**: Financial and healthcare customers require verifiable code quality. Tests provide audit trails  
3. **Multi-tenant Reliability**: One customer's workload cannot impact another's. Tests ensure proper isolation
4. **Performance SLAs**: Enterprise customers have strict performance requirements. Tests validate behavior under load
5. **API Stability**: Breaking changes can affect thousands of applications. Tests prevent regressions
6. **Distributed System Complexity**: Complex interactions between storage nodes require comprehensive testing

### Mandatory Unit Tests
**EVERY implementation MUST include unit tests** without being explicitly asked. Follow these patterns:

1. Test functions must use `#[test]` or `#[tokio::test]` attributes
2. Use parameterized tests or loop through test cases for multiple scenarios
3. Cover both success and error cases, including edge conditions
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. **Test coverage guideline**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of new code paths
6. Include negative tests for error conditions and boundary cases
7. Add benchmarks for performance-critical code paths

## Improvement Suggestions

Claude will periodically analyze the codebase and suggest:
- Missing test coverage areas
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring opportunities
- Security improvements
- Documentation gaps

## Testing Commands

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before any code changes:
1. ✅ Run `cargo fmt --all` to check and fix code formatting
2. ✅ Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
3. ✅ Run `cargo clippy` to check for common mistakes
4. ✅ Ensure new code has appropriate test coverage
5. ✅ Verify no redundant comments are added

## Directory Structure Conventions

- `/src` - Main library source code
- `/tests` - Integration tests
- `/examples` - Example usage code
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `/benches` - Performance benchmarks

## Common Patterns to Follow

### Logging
Use the log crate with appropriate macros:

```rust
use log::{debug, error, info, trace, warn};

// Examples:
info!("Starting operation: {}", operation_name);
debug!("Request details: {:?}", request);
error!("Operation failed: {}", err);
```

### Error Handling
Use the `Result` type with proper error propagation:

```rust
use crate::s3::error::Error;

fn operation() -> Result<Response, Error> {
    let result = risky_operation()?;
    Ok(process(result))
}
```

## Quick Reference

- **Fix formatting**: `cargo fmt --all`
- **Run tests**: `cargo test`
- **Run specific test**: `cargo test test_name`
- **Check code**: `cargo clippy`
- **Build project**: `cargo build --release`
- **Generate docs**: `cargo doc --open`
